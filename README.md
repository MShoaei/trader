# ⚠️ CAUTION ⚠️

This project is far from complete. Use it at your own risk, I do not take responsibility for any losses that may occur

## Trader

This is both a bot and a command-line interface for trading cryptocurrency on [binance](https://binance.com)

## API

you can start the web server by running:

```go
$ ./trader server
```

`PORT` environment variable **MUST** be defined.
if you want to use any interface other than `127.0.0.1` you need to modify the code.

sample reuqests are available under [requests](./requests) directory
